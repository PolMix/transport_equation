# Solving heat transfer equation
This code is written in support to my course work. The task was to numerically solve differential equation of transport equation in 2 dimesional space (X, t) and represent numerical solution in graph

Instruments I used:
- Matplotlib library for plotting
- Pandas library for numerical processing

The code was written using:
- Recursion
- Knowledge of advanced mathematical analysis
