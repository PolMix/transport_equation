# Solving heat transfer equation
This code is written in support to my course work. The task was to numerically solve differential equation of heat transfer in 3 dimesional space and represent numerical solution in graph

Instruments I used:
- Matplotlib library for plotting
- Pandas library for numerical processing

The code was written using:
- Recursion
- Knowledge of advanced mathematical analysis
